    HELP!!!
    <p>This utility will assist in managing (1) or more PinPads</p>
    <p>PackingList.txt - contains list (1-4) of files to be deployed to the pinpad.</p>
    <p>Disclaimer:  This application does not provide for hot swapping (until someone pays for development).  For now, if you add additional PinPads, you must restart the application.</p>
